    "#### In this notebook we will set up a numerical snow model named SNOWPACK. We will then run the model and analyze the results. Note that the numerical simulations require several minutes to run.\n",

    "#### Numerical models are a commonly used tool to understand ice sheets. They contribute to our current and past understanding of ice sheet behavior. Notebaly they also allow us to make predictions about the future. Numerical models combine our physical understanding of snow and ice along with mathematics and computers to produce detailed estimates of snow and ice properties such as temperature and density. "

    "#### You can modify the SNOWPACK simulation by perturbing the input weather data via multiplicative and/or additive factors. For example, setting the air temperature multiplicative factor to 1.1 will multiply the air temperature (in Kelvin) by 1.1. Likewise, setting the the incoming shortwave radiation additive factor to 50, will increase the incoming shortwave radiation by 50 Wm$^{-2}$. Note that although it possible to modify the weather data in rather extreme ways (e.g. setting the air temperature multiplicative factor to 100), SNOWPACK will likely encounter numerical stability and or physics issues, as the model is designed for typical alpine and polar meteorological conditions! In fact, checks inside SNOWPACK may decide your modification is unrealistic and throw it out. In short, providing SNOWPACK with extereme weather data may cause SNOWPACK act strangely. With great power, comes great responsibility! :p"

    "\n",
    "#### You can modify the SNOWPACK simulation by perturbing the input weather data via multiplicative and/or additive factors. For example, setting the air temperature multiplicative factor to 1.1 will multiply the air temperature (in Kelvin) by 1.1. Likewise, setting the the incoming shortwave radiation additive factor to 50, will increase the incoming shortwave radiation by 50 Wm$^{-2}$. Note that although it possible to modify the weather data in rather extreme ways (e.g. setting the air temperature multiplicative factor to 100), SNOWPACK will likely encounter numerical stability and or physics issues, as the model is designed for typical alpine and polar meteorological conditions! In fact, checks inside SNOWPACK may decide your modification is unrealistic and throw it out. In short, providing SNOWPACK with extereme weather data may cause SNOWPACK act strangely. With great power, comes great responsibility! :p"
