Notebaly they also allow us to make predictions about the future. Numerical models combine our physical understanding of snow and ice along with mathematics and computers to produce detailed estimates of snow and ice properties such as temperature and density. "

Likewise, setting the the incoming shortwave radiation additive factor to 50, will increase the incoming shortwave radiation by 50 Wm$^{-2}$. Note that although it possible to modify the weather data in rather extreme ways (e.g. setting the air temperature multiplicative factor to 100), SNOWPACK will likely encounter numerical stability and or physics issues, as the model is designed for typical alpine and polar meteorological conditions! In fact, checks inside SNOWPACK may decide your modification is unrealistic and throw it out. In short, providing SNOWPACK with extereme weather data may cause SNOWPACK act strangely.
